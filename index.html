                <p><strong>What is this</strong>:<br /> <a href="https://www.governor.state.nm.us/2020/03/12/new-mexico-schools-to-temporarily-close/" target="blank">New Mexico public schools will close</a> for three weeks beginning March 16 in an effort to limit the potential community spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
                <p>The closures affect tens of thousands of New Mexico residents, and creates a large burden on families who need to ensure children continue to be fed and cared for.</p>
                <p>This project is an attempt to identify those schools offering "Grab and Go" meal pick up for parents. Enter your address and you will see which schools near you are offering this service. In nearly all cases, the student of students must be with a parent in order to receive a meal.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the data comes from <a href="https://www.newmexico.gov/education/meal-sites-for-children/" target="blank">a list made available</a> by the state of New Mexico.</p>
                <p>As the data is subject to change, it's important that you visit the links to indivdual school districts to verify dates, hours and procedures for meal pickup.</p>
